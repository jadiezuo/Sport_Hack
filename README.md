In this project, we conduct exploratory data analysis using play-by-play data set for all games from 2011-2012 season. Specifically, attention is paid on time-out usage. Interesting facts about time-out in NBA games are revealed from various aspects. Additionally, we develop insights on the effectivenees of time-out in the short term. Addionally, an attemp to test whether Hack-a-Shaq strategy works or not by Monte Carlo Simulation is made. Using data set orignized for players, we estimate the parameters for score, which is fitted by a compound Poisson Process.
